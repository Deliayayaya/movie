You can read this file for more information on how to get started. You can also read the website we've made: http://towerjs.org. There are also plenty of screencasts here: http://towerjs.org/screencast.\n\n## Install\n\nYou've probably already got `tower` installed if you're reading this, but just in case we've provided a little instruction. To get started with Tower you'll need the following software:\n\n- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n- [Node Package Manager](https://npmjs.org/) (aka, npm)\n- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)\n\nWith those two installed you only need to do the following steps to create your first app:\n\n1. `npm install -g forever tower`\n2. `tower new app-name-here`\n3. `cd app-name-here`\n4. `npm install`\n\nNext you need to run the watcher to compile your assets. Run this in a new window that you'll keep open:\n\n```\ncake watch\n```\n\nIf you don't have the `cake` command, install coffeescript globally with `npm install -g coffee-script`.\n\nNow your application is fully setup and ready to run with `forever`:\n\n```\nforever server.js\n```\n\nYou can discover the other commands by using `tower --help`. You also have access to a console with `tower console`. Look to the `Cakefile` for more commands.\n\n## Test\n\nRun tests:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nRead up on [testing Tower.js apps](http://towerjs.org/guides/testing).\n\n## Deploy\n\n[How to deploy Tower Apps to Heroku](http://towerjs.org/guides/deployment#heroku).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Tower.js](http://towerjs.org/guides)\n- [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)\n- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries)\n- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.11/api/fs.html)\n- [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha)\n- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)\n- [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/)\n\nIf all else fails, see the [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/), should be fairly close.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"power@0.1.0","dist":{"shasum":"b0d2974f46f94343a4061e176ce78e7daf929b1a","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/power/-/power-0.1.0.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.65","_npmUser":{"name":"feilaoda","email":"azhenglive@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"_shasum":"b0d2974f46f94343a4061e176ce78e7daf929b1a","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/power/-/power-0.1.0.tgz","_from":"power@latest"}
