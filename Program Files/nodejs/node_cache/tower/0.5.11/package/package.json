It has minimal dependencies. It doesn't depend on jQuery, underscore, mongodb, or any such \"limiting\" factor. It's all JavaScript. Each micro component is around 1kb, so if you wanted to make things super lean, you can just grab the bare bones you need.\n\nSome things that were in 0.4.0 aren't there yet in 0.5.0, in particular relations. However, the new way you build modules makes writing these things much easier. This time around solid API principles are in place. Everything must be fast (performance), small (file size), and simple, so it requires minimal mental energy to dig into the code. Needless to say, this is still super alpha software.\n\nIf there's anything in particular you're wondering about, join in the #towerjs IRC.\n\nThe source for the guides on the site are here: https://github.com/tower/guides. They're very much a work in progress.\n\n## Installation\n\nnode.js:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install tower\n```\n\nto get the cli:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install tower-cli -g\n```\n\nbrowser:\n\n```bash\n$ component install tower/tower\n```\n\nThis is installed through [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\n## Example\n\nThis main module is just a collection of tiny components to make it easy to get going. See the [individual repositories](https://github.com/tower) for details on how to use each one. Enjoy!\n\n```js\nvar tower = require('tower');\n\ntower.resource;\ntower.query;\ntower.adapter;\ntower.router;\ntower.route;\ntower.validator;\ntower.type;\ntower.memory;\n```\n\nAll of those modules are available on both the client and the server.\n\nIf you're on the client, you also have template rendering components (they're just about ready for the server too):\n\n```js\ntower.template;\ntower.content;\ntower.directive;\n```\n\n## Tower Cli\n\n```bash\n$ tower <verb> <object> [options]\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n$ tower create recipe my-recipe\n$ tower install recipe my-recipe\n$ tower start mongodb\n$ tower stop mongodb\n$ tower enter mongodb\n$ tower start\n$ tower stop\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT.","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"tower@0.5.11","dist":{"shasum":"b91d5d1fa03c93d026598037dfdab46d26b2cbe7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/tower/-/tower-0.5.11.tgz"},"_from":"tower@>=0.4.2","_npmVersion":"1.3.8","_npmUser":{"name":"viatropos","email":"lancejpollard@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"_shasum":"b91d5d1fa03c93d026598037dfdab46d26b2cbe7","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/tower/-/tower-0.5.11.tgz"}
